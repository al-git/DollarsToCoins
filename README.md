# dollarsToCoins
Ongoing project to test deriving various permutations of user-input using dollars-to-coins as context.

This test project will target the concept of deriving possible permutations of user-input for an upcoming project that will heavily rely on this functionality. 
The intended outcome is:
  - Prompt user to enter a dollar amount
  - Provide all (or variety) of possible coin-equivalent variations of user-input
